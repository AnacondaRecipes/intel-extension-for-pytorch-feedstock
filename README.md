Summary: Intel速 Extension for PyTorch for extra performance boost on Intel hardware.

Intel速 Extension for PyTorch extends PyTorch with up-to-date features optimizations
for an extra performance boost on Intel hardware. Optimizations take advantage of
AVX-512 Vector Neural Network Instructions (AVX512 VNNI)and Intel速 Advanced Matrix Extensions
(Intel速 AMX) on Intel CPUs as well as Intel Xe Matrix Extensions (XMX) AI engines on
Intel discrete GPUs.
